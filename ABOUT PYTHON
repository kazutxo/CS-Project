Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991. It is used for developing desktop GUI applications, websites, and web applications.

Advantages and Features of Python:

1. Simple: Python is a simple and minimalistic language. The pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths.

2. Easy to Learn: Python has an extraordinarily simple syntax, making it easier to learn.

3. Free and Open Source: One can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs.

4. High-Level Language: While writing programs in Python, one does not need to worry about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.

5. Portable: Python can work on many platforms, such as Linux and Windows.

6. Interpreted: Python does not require compilation to binary. The program is run directly from the source code.

7. Extensible: A Python code can be written in C or C++ language that can be compiled in C/C++ language.

8. Embeddable: Python can be embedded within C/C++ to give scripting capabilities for the program's users.

9. Extensive Libraries: The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python program, simplifying the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly used commands. They can be used by calling/importing them at the beginning of a script.
