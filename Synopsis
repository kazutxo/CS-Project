As the world becomes increasingly computer-dependent, this project introduces the Art Gallery Management System. It alleviates burdensome manual handling of artist records, artwork inventory, exhibitions, and sales, streamlining operations for art galleries and small exhibitions. The system provides easy access to data through various modules, enhancing productivity and efficiency. Developed using Python and MySQL, it offers a comprehensive solution for art gallery management. With its user-friendly interface and secure data storage, the system improves data organization, reduces errors, and facilitates informed decision-making. This project aims to modernize art gallery operations, making management tasks simpler and more efficient.
