As the world becomes increasingly reliant on computer systems, this project introduces the Art Gallery Management System, a solution designed to streamline the management of artists, artwork inventories, exhibitions, and sales. The system reduces the need for manual record-keeping by offering robust features for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records across these domains. Built using Python and MySQL, it leverages a user-friendly, menu-driven interface to ensure easy navigation and interaction.

Key features include artist and artwork management, comprehensive reporting, exhibition tracking, and sales recording, all backed by secure data storage and integrity through relational database design. Error handling and input validation enhance reliability by reducing mistakes, while tabular data presentation improves accessibility. The system simplifies data organization, ensures consistency, and aids decision-making by providing real-time access to well-structured information.

This project modernizes art gallery operations, making management tasks simpler, efficient, and scalable for galleries and small exhibitions alike, contributing to improved productivity and operational excellence.
